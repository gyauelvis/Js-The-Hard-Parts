// Challenge 1
// Replace the blank underscores inside the console logs with the data type (i.e. 'string') you think each value will be. (Leave the quotes)
// Ex.
// var myStr = "hello"
//   console.log(typeof myStr === "string") //=> true
// Challenge 2
// Create a functon buildSentence that takes three words (strings) and adds them together and console.logs the whole sentence (string) complete with capitalization and punctuation.
// Challenge 3
// Create a function lastLetter that takes a word (string) and console.logs the last character/letter of that word.
// Hint: Remember that each character/letter in a string has an index position that you can access with brackets: []
// Challenge 4
// Create a function buildGreeting that takes a time (integer) and a name (string) and print a greeting based on the following rules:
// If time is between 0 (inclusive) and 11 (inclusive): "Good Morning, <name>!
// If time is between 12 (inclusive) and 16 (inclusive): "Good Afternoon, <name>!
// If time is between 17 (inclusive) and 23 (inclusive): "Good Evening, <name>!
// If time is anything else: "That's not a real time, <name>. Maybe you need some sleep!
// Challenge 5
// indexOf is a function that you can call on a string (string1) and accepts another string (string2) as an argument.
// It searches through string1 from left to right checking each character to see if it can find string2.
// If it finds string2 it returns the index position of the FIRST character that matches string2. If it cannot find string2 it returns negative one: -1.
// Enter the index position you think indexOf will return for each below.
// Challenge 6
// Create a function letterExists that takes a word (string) and a character (string), and console.logs whether that letter can be found inside that word.
// Challenge 7
// Create a function isPrime that console.logs a boolean indicating if `number` is prime or not.
// Challenge 8
// Create a function range that console.logs all numbers between 'start' and 'end' in sequential order.
// Challenge 9
// Create a function myIndexOf that takes an array and an element and console.logs the index of the element in the array, or -1 if it doesn't exist.
// Assume the `ele` will be a primitive data type (no arrays or objects).
// DO NOT USE THE BUILT-IN `indexOf` METHOD IN YOUR SOLUTION!
// Challenge 10
// Create a function unique that console.logs an array where all the duplicates of the input array have been removed; in other words, every element remaining is unique.
// Challenge 11
// Create a function longestWord that that retuns the longest word of a sentence.
// If there are ties, the function should return the later word.
// Challenge 12
// Create a function disemvowel that takes in a string and returns a string with all vowels removed.
// Challenge 13
// Create a function divisibleByFivePairSum that takes an array of numbers.
// It should return an array of all the pairs of indices whose sum is a multiple of five.
// Challenge 14
// Create a function highestScore that takes in an array of student objects as a parameter.

// It should return a string that corresponds to the student with the highest score.

// The string should contain that student's initials concatenated with their id.

// Assume the array contains at least 1 student object and the student with the highest score is unique (there are no ties).
// Challenge 15
// Create a function leastCommonMultiple that takes two numbers (integers) as input and returns the lowest number which is a multiple of both inputs.
// Extension 1
// Create a function arrayBuilder that takes in a count object and returns an array filled with the appropriate numbers of elements. The order of the elements in the array does not matter, but repeated elements should be grouped.
// Extension 2
// Create a function objectBuilder that takes in a number and returns an object whose keys are 0 up to number and the values are that same number multipled by 5.
// Extension 3
// Create a function secretCipher that takes in an string(sentence) and an object(cipher). Return a string where every character is replaced with its cooresponding value in the cipher. If the character doesn't exist in the cipher, use the original character.
// Extension 4
// Create a function passingStudents that accepts an array of student objects.
// It should iterate through the list of students and return an array of the names of all the students who have an average grade of at least 70.
